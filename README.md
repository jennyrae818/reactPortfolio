## Description

My Portfolio Page is here for you!
<br>
<br>
I wanted to make a page that is easy for the user to navigate and where they can quickly get to know me a little better. 
<br>
<br>
You can read a bit more about me, navigate through my recent project links, visit my professional LinkedIn profile, read my brief resume, or contact me directly. 
<br>
<br>
This is a new addition to my portfolio using React for the first time since the start of my University of Washington Full Stack Web Development class in December 2021.
